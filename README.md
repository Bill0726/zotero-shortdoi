# Zotero shortDOI Lookup

This is an add-on for Zotero, a research source management tool. The add-on can look up shortDOI names using http://shortdoi.org and store them for Zotero items. 

Please report any bugs, questions, or feature requests on the Zotero forums.

Code for this extension is based heavily on [Zotero Google Scholar Citations](https://github.com/beloglazov/zotero-scholar-citations) by Anton Beloglazov.
